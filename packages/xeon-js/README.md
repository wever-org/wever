# xeon-js
The main script library of wever js. This is the library where all the methods like `XSET()`, `createElement()`, `HTMLElement.update(element: XSETObject)` exists. You can directly use them by importing them via the object destructuring method or you can also get them from xeon class.

## How to use independently?
* Clone or download the repository in your local mechanic.
* Run command `npm install` in the terminal (within the directory).
* Then start the server using `npm start`.

Your app will be hosted in Port 3000. Go to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/).

Try editing the `entry.js` file.

Currently the project is under construction, so HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is unavailable.
